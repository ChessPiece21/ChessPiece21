### Hi there, I'm Joe! ðŸ‘‹
<br>
I am interested in, and actively looking for opportunities for involvement in, digital humanities scholarship and education, as well as instructional design and data storytelling. I am comfortable with R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have some experience with Python and XML.
<br>
I also have a growing collection of [neat datasets](https://github.com/ChessPiece21/Neat-Datasets) I've found or made.
<br>
For more information about me and some projects I've done, see [my website](https://chesspiece21.github.io/). Thanks for visiting!
